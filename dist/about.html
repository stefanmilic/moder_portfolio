          computer etc.

        <h4>My dream Job Prepravi</h4>
        <p>As one developer I was not satisfied with the work in high school where I was doing some basic things. I was
          given the opportunity to work in the local municipality, I thought it would be better there, but the
          situation was the
          same. My job wasn't difficult, but I wasn't happy. All I learned at college and and my own lot of staff but i
          didn't use.
          That's why I decided to go for my dream to become a successful programmer, I want to learn more and progress
          in IT world.</p>
