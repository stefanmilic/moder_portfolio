        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>I finished Gimnazija high school in 2012 and then in same year I enrolled in the faculty of technical
          science on department IT sector. After 5 years, I finished college in October 2017 with
          an average degree of 8.50 (eight and fifty).
          Currently attending Master studies.

      <div data-aos="fade-left" class="job job-2">
        <h4>First Job</h4>
        <p>In march 2017 my faculty gives me a chance to work as volunteer in High technical school. At the start
          that
          was very good opportunity for me to see how one serious institution works. And i started with basic stuff,
          maintenance website, computer networking, programming routers and checking the hardware's correctness.
          After one month I started receiving the salary. This job gave me opportunity for better acquainting with
          HTML, CSS, Java Script, Web services and how information
          system works and what it consists
        </p>

      <div data-aos="fade-right" class="job job-3">
        <h4>My dream Job Prepravi</h4>
        <p>As one developer I was not satisfied with the work in high school where I was doing some basic things. I was
          given the opportunity to work in the local municipality, I thought it would be better there, but the
          situation was the
          same. diagnosing computer problems, monitoring computer processing systems, set up workstations, develop and
          maintain local networks in ways that optimize performance, perform
          troubleshooting to diagnose and resolve problems (repair or replace parts, debugging etc.) Also, I assist
          employees with computer problems, teaching them how properly use computer's software and answer on their
          questions and other. My
          job wasn't difficult, but I wasn't happy. All I learned at college and my own lot of staff but i didn't use.
          That's why I decided to go for my dream to become a successful programmer, I want to learn more and
          progress
          in IT world.</p>
